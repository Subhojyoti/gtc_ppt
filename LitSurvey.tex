\begin{itemize}
\item<1-> A considerable amount of research has been conducted on SMAB. We can divide the gamut of literature on SMAB into broadly two categories:
\begin{itemize}
\item<2-> \textbf{Frequentist approach:} In this approach for each of the arms compute a dynamic allocation index that depends only on the number of draws on the arm and choose the arm with the maximal index. Eg:  \emph{UCB} variants
\item<3-> \textbf{Bayesian Approach:} In this approach you start with a prior guess over the performance of each of the arms, then you pull an arm and based on the reward received we update our posterior guess on the performance of the arm. 
\end{itemize} 
\item<4-> We will be focusing on UCB based approaches in our work.

\begin{itemize}
\item<1-> The literature under UCB can be broadly classified into three categories:
\begin{itemize}
\item<2-> \textbf{Mean-based estimation: } In this approach at every timestep we choose an arm based on $\hat{r}_i$ and its confidence interval $c_i$. Eg: UCB1 \cite{auer2002finite}, MOSS \cite{audibert2009minimax}, UCB-Improved \cite{auer2010ucb}
\item<3-> \textbf{Mean and Variance based Estimation: } Here, at every timestep we choose an arm based on $\hat{r}_i$, $\hat{V}_i$ and its confidence interval $c_i$. Eg: UCB-Norma \cite{auer2002finite}l, UCB-V \cite{audibert2009exploration}.
\item<4-> \textbf{Divergence based methods: } Eg: KL-UCB \cite{garivier2011kl}, DMED \cite{honda2010asymptotically}.

\frametitle{Problems of UCB-Improved}
\begin{itemize}
\item<1-> UCB-Improved conducts too much early exploration.
\item<2-> The arm elimination condition of UCB-Imp is very conservative.
\item<3-> When the gaps are small and uniform UCB-Imp performs very badly.
\item<4-> There is a gap in theoretical guarantee and empirical performance.  
\end{itemize}

\frametitle{Problem Definition}
\begin{itemize}
\item<1-> In our work, we ask the following set of questions:
\begin{itemize}
\item<2-> Can we achieve a better gap-dependent/gap-independent regret bound than UCB-Improved?
\item<3-> Can we bridge the theoretical versus empirical performance of UCB-Imp?
\item<4-> Can we use ideas from Clustering to achieve this?
\item<5-> Can we study the effect of Clustering in SMAB? 
\end{itemize} 
\item<6-> The answer to all of this is ClusUCB.
\end{itemize}

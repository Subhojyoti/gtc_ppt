\begin{itemize}
\item<1-> We proposed the EUCBV algorithm for the SMAB setting which uses variance and mean estimation along with arm elimination to give an order-optimal theoretical guarantee.
\item<2-> We proposed the AugUCB algorithm for the fixed budget TBP  which uses variance estimation and arm elimination to give improved theoretical and experimental guarantees than mean estimation based algorithms.
\item<3-> Further studies are required to establish a lower bound on the expected loss of AugUCB.
\item<4-> A more detailed analysis of the non-uniform arm selection and parameter selection is also required for both AugUCB and EUCBV.

\begin{itemize}
\item<1-> We propose the Efficient-UCB-Variance (EUCBV) algorithm for the SMAB setting.
\item<2-> EUCBV takes into account the empirical variances of the arms along with mean estimates to quickly find the optimal arm.
\item<3-> It is the first variance-based arm elimination algorithm for the considered SMAB setting. 
\item<4-> It addresses an open problem discussed in {Auer and Ortner (2010)} of designing an algorithm that can eliminate arms based on variance estimates.
\item<5-> Theoretically it achieves an order-optimal regret bound, the first for an arm elimination algorithm in SMAB setting.
\item<6-> Empirically, it outperforms all the state-of-the-art algorithms for the considered environments.
%\item<5-> We also define a new problem complexity which uses empirical variance estimates along with arm's mean for giving the theoretical bound.

\frametitle{Conclusion}
\begin{itemize}
\item<1-> We introduced the ClusUCB and EClusUCB algorithms which achieves a better gap-dependent regret bound than UCB1, UCB-Imp and Moss.
\item<2-> Empirically EClusUCB beats most of the UCB variants.
\item<3-> This are the first algorithms which employ clustering in SMABs.
\item<4-> We prove theoretically that for arm elimination algorithms, Clustering is indeed beneficial.
\end{itemize}

\frametitle{Conclusion}
\begin{itemize}
\item<1-> We proposed the AugUCB algorithm for the fixed budget TBP setting which has an improved theoretical and experimental guarantees than APT.
\item<2-> Further studies are required to establish a lower bound on the expected loss of AugUCB.
\item<3-> A more detailed analysis of the non-uniform arm selection and parameter selection is also required.
\end{itemize}

\frametitle{Future direction in MS}
\begin{itemize}
\item<1-> We have proposed a very similar algorithm as in AugUCB for the SMAB problem with more detailed study of non-uniform arm selection and parameter selection.
\item<2-> Termed as Efficient UCBV, we are preparing for submission for AAAI 2018.
\item<3-> I am going to INRIA, SequeL Lab, Lille, France for a three month internship starting from 1st September under Dr. Odalric Maillard.

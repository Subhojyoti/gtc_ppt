\frametitle{Conclusion}
\begin{itemize}
\item<1-> We proposed the AugUCB algorithm for the fixed budget TBP  which uses variance estimation and arm elimination to give an improved theoretical and experimental guarantees than APT.
\item<1-> This work has been accepted in the proceedings of IJCAI 2017.
\item<2-> Further studies are required to establish a lower bound on the expected loss of AugUCB.
\item<3-> A more detailed analysis of the non-uniform arm selection and parameter selection is also required.
\end{itemize}

%\begin{itemize}
%\item<1-> This work has been accepted in IJCAI 2017.
%\item<2-> We have proposed a very similar algorithm as like AugUCB for the SMAB (single best arm) problem with more detailed study of non-uniform arm selection and parameter selection.
%\item<3-> Termed as Efficient UCBV, we are preparing for submission for AAAI 2018.
%\item<4-> I am going to INRIA, SequeL Lab, Lille, France for a three month internship starting from 1st September under Dr. Odalric Maillard.

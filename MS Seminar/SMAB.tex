\frametitle{Stochastic Multi-Armed Bandit Problem (SMAB)}
\begin{itemize}
\item<1-> The thresholding bandit problem falls under the broad area of stochastic multi-armed bandit problem.
\item<2-> In SMAB problem, we are presented with a finite set of actions or arms. 
\item<3-> The rewards for each of the arms are identical and independent random variables drawn from distribution specific to the arm.
\item<4-> The learner does not know the mean of the distributions, denoted by $r_{i},\forall i\in A$ and the variance denoted by $\sigma_i^2$. 
\item<5-> The distributions for each of the arms are fixed throughout the time horizon denoted by $T$. 
\end{itemize}
